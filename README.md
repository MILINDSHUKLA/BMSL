# BOOKS MONITORING SYSTEM FOR LIBRARIES (BMSL)
Our idea is related to the library, because we believe that the library is the back bone of the university, in this idea we have thought of keeping the Books Monitoring System for Libraries (BMSL) under the university utility software.

Under this there will be an smsl window which will have information about all department wise books of the university. Students and staff will have login details so that they will be able to check library stock through their account.

For students:
Their window will mainly have information about the availability of books in library, like if there is a book A, then the student will be able to see whether that book is present in the section of the library or not. Auto generated email reminder which they can activate or deactivate from there account. A suggestion Box.

For Library Staff:
Here the features will be more and it will be based on real time monitor, in which along with the availability of the book, the information and time period of the students who have taken the book will be known.

Along with this, there will also be a feature in which the number of books of which departments have been returned, the time has exceeded and the number of books in the section will also be known.
